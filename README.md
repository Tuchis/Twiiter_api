# Twiiter_api
Twitter API laboratory

There are two programs, first in folder 'Second', the other in folder 'Third'.

## Program Second.
That is a program for laboratory in UCU. The main task is to learn how to work with API, and for that we are using Twitter API. We are using it to get .json files and to realise orientation through it.

You have few possible ways to start the program. You can use uploaded data for tests. That is .json files, which are result of Twitter API. The second is to get .json files with your keys from Twitter API. You have to type them into file hidden.py, and after that everything should work.

The program is getting files using Twitter API. It can get your recent tweets, or friends list, you can choose by yourself. Also, you can choose amount of tweets or friedns, that will be analyzed. Alos for better navigation there are keywords like 'BACK', 'EXIT' and '-1'

BACK - gets one lever higher in your .json file (shows parent of your object)
EXIT - end the program
-1 - gets to the highest level of your program (you get to the highest element of your program)

The program has instructins in it, so everything is very easy to undestand.

## Program Third.
That is a program for laboratory in UCU. The main task is to host the site that is implemented with flask and html at pythonanywhere.com. Alos, there are being used Twitter API and Folium.

The programs gets the username of Twitter user and amount of his friends, that are going to be proceeded. Then, with use of Twitter API, it gets the .json file about user's friends. This data is used to show the locations of friedns at the map. This is done with folium and geopy.

The program is hosted at the following link, and if it is on, you should enjoy it. ***But Twitter API has limited requests, that's why you shouldn't use it too often, unless you want to wait ~ 15 minutes for new requests ))***

If you want to launc at your PC, you have to start it using and Flask and you have to type keys for Twitter API into file hidden.py, and after that everything should work.
